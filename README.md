Build
-----
I use [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for development. Here are the available tasks:

| Task         | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| `main:build` | Build source files of Aerodial library |
| `doc:build`  | Build source files of the document |
| `dev`        | Build all source files and watch for changes |

Running a task with `--production` generates compiled code for production.
