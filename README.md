Aerodial
========

Overview
--------
Aerodial is a Javascript library that provides a compact user interface for fine-tuning/monitoring values. It's originally inspired by the popular library [dat.GUI](http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui/).


Demo/Usage
----------
See [official page](https://www.mechanikadesign.com/aerodial/) for more information.


Build
-----
I use [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for development. Here are the available tasks:

| Task       | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| main:build | Build source files of Aerodial library |
| doc:build  | Build source files for documentation |
| dev        | Build all source files and watch for changes |

Running a task with `--production` generates compiled code for production.
